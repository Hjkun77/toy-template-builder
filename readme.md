[View demo](https://toy-template-builder.kierb.com/) / [View video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y80z44WavAk&feature=youtu.be)

## Setup
You will need npm `>=5` and Node.js `>=10`.

- Install the dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

- Start Parcel, and you're good to go.
```bash
npm start
```

It should open up to your a new browser window shortly. However, if it doesn't, you can manually open http://localhost:1234.

## Deployment
The web interface is hosted on Netlify for free. Set the public folder to `dist`. For the build command:
```bash
npm run build
```
